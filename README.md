# Enron-Fraud

# Project Overview

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

In the year 2000, Enron was known as one of the largest energy companies in the United States, claiming nearly $111 billion in revenues. At the end of 2001, it was revealed that there was widespread corporate fraud. Essentially all of Enron's nonexistent profits were created through a method called "mark-to-market" accounting, in which they would report profits even though they didn't earn a single dime. Even worse, they were solely responsible for the California electricity crisis, by which they performed large-scale blackouts to seize arbitrage opportunities.

The goal for this project is to analyze the characteristics of employees who worked at Enron during the crisis to predict if they are a person of interest ("POI"). Various resources (documentaries, news articles, etc.) were used to label people in the data set as POIs if they were previously indicted (that is, there is a 100% chance they were guilty). The application of machine learning to this project may be of assistance if we take the predictions from the Enron data model and apply them to other companies facing similar circumstances, through identifying persons of interest (we are using a naive assumption here by assuming fraud at other companies is similar to that of Enron, which may or may not be the case).

In this project machine learning skills will be applied by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.
